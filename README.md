# Chesty for Minecraft 1.4.7

Chesty is a fully functioning moving chest with some additional features. Chesty will loyally follow you around to the end of the world, always providing you portable storage.

You can extend the functionality of Chesty by also installing the [IronChest](https://github.com/cpw/ironchest/releases/tag/v5.1) mod, which will allow you to use an IronChest chest on Chesty to upgrade it to that type, increasing the health and storage of Chesty.

### Currently Working Content
* You can store a full set of armor, two utility slots for food or tools only, and then 18 items of your choice (9 less than a stationary chest, upgradable via the [IronChest](https://github.com/cpw/ironchest/releases/tag/v5.1) mod).
* You use the Sceptre of Chests to spawn Chesty, while you have the sceptre with you he will continue to follow you. You can shift+click the sceptre to despawn him as you please.
* The Sceptre of Chests is the actual item storage, meaning you can kill other people for the sceptre and not only get another sceptre, but all of their loot they had inside Chesty.
* If you have the [IronChest](https://github.com/cpw/ironchest/releases/tag/v5.1) mod installed you are able to right click on Chesty with any chest to upgrade it to that version, increasing the inventory size and health of chesty. Using a normal chest will downgrade him to his default state. Currently Chesty has to be completely empty in order to upgrade/downgrade. Can be disabled, but if a server has it enabled then support will be forcefully enabled.

### Planned/Potential Content
* Potentially let you right click on a chest with the Sceptre of Chests to automatically clone that one into a Chesty instead of right clicking Chesty with a chest.
* A garbage slot (suggested that it 'poops' it out in some way)
* Picks up nearby items (Possibly a checkbox to enable this, somehow?)
* Crystal Chest upgrade should render the same way where you can see about 8 of the top items rendered inside him.
