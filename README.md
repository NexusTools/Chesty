Chesty is simply a fully functioning chest with additional features that will loyally follow you around to the end of the world, always providing you portable storage.

### Currently Working Content
* You can store a full set of armor, any sort of tool, and an additonal slot for whatever and then 18 items of your choice (9 less than a stationary chest).
* Chesty can be tamed by simply interacting with him for now.
* Chesty follows you once tamed

### Planned/Potential Content
* A rod that, when carried, will actually spawn Chesty.
* If a player kills a person with the rod, allow them to steal that Chesty's contents.
* A slot for food in Chesty to allow Chesty to heal himself.
* Ability to armor Chesty
* Potential chest upgrades based on the IronChests, which could be increase size and the base armor of Chesty.
* Potentially a way to have Chesty help defend. Or maybe once Chesty's owner dies he becomes rabid and begins killing everything.
